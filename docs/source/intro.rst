Introduction
============

``NestifyDict`` is a tool for parsing structured data (primarily nested dictionaries from json files). 
In particular it can flatten dictionaries, map flattened dicts to a template, and recursively get/set elements in nested dictionaries without a priori knowledge of the structure.
As opposed to other methods, we generally assume a fixed unknown structure exists.
